# Movie-Recommendation-Chatbot
The chatbot uses a recommendation engine to suggest <b>similar movies</b> with their IMDB links and posters. In addition, it also provides information about the following properties of the movie input by the user:
<ul>
<li>movie genre</li>
<li>movie plot</li>
<li>revenue</li>
<li>budget</li>
<li>IMDB rating</li>
<li>IMDB site link</li>
</ul>

A few machine learning modules were used to build the recommendation engine and Slack API was used to provide the front end. Since the chatbot is hosted on Slack, multiple users can communicate with it at the same time.
