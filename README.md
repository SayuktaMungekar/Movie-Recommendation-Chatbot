# Movie-Recommendation-Chatbot
The chatbot uses a recommendation engine to suggest similar movies and also provides information about a movie like genre, revenue, imdb links, etc. A few machine learning modules were used to build the recommendation engine and Slack API was used to provide the front end. Since the chatbot is hosted on Slack, multiple users can communicate with it at the same time.
